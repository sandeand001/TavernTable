# Taverntable (GitHub Pages)

This folder is prepared for GitHub Pages deployment.

- `index.html` is the entry point. Replace its contents with your main app if needed.
- `.nojekyll` disables Jekyll processing (required for folders/files starting with `_`).
- All assets and scripts should use relative paths (e.g., `../src/ui/UIController.js`).

## How to Deploy
1. Go to your repo's **Settings > Pages**.
2. Set source to branch `feature/terrain-system` and folder `/docs`.
3. Save and wait for the published link.

## Update
- To update your app, edit files in `docs/` and push changes.
- For a full app, copy your main `index.html` and assets here.
